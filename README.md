//Warthunder Discord Bot\\

This bot is a personal project of mine based aroud the game "War Thunder"
it is intergrated into a discord server with just over 1000 members who also play the game.

Features:

- Scrape data from warthunders squadron webpage to return player name, personal squadron rating and battle activity.
- Return this scraped data through the front end buttons, Top 5 players with most points, players who have more that 850 personal squadron rating etc etc
- Allow players to select the vehicles they have for a specific "battle rating", entries then saved in PostgreSQL database for later reference, list of vehicles is pulled from the same database.

//Features still in development\\
- send a message into a specified discord channel when user joins a voice chat, if no vehicles are present for the current battlerating a ping will notify the user that they need to enter their vehicles in the database.
- "Man management" features to be built in for Admin work
- Quality of life additions for members
- Automatic role managment based on Warthunder points. eg 0 points role removed after player has > 0 points.

**more features coming soon**
